## 2. Touch Targets (Elementary Precision Rule)

## 3. High-Contrast & Elementary Readability

* **Contrast Ratio:** Text-to-background contrast must maintain at least **4.5:1** across all surface container roles to ensure readability under bright tropical classroom lighting.
* **Typography Scale:** Avoid dense, tiny fonts. Use minimum 14sp for body text and 18sp for titles.
* **Subject Color Coding:**
  * **Science (Agham):** Green accents (`#146C2E` / `#C4EED0`).
  * **Mathematics (Matematika):** Blue accents (`#0B57D0` / `#D3E3FD`).
