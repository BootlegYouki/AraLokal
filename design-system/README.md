## 3. Core Standards for Developers

### Color Contrast
* Text-to-background contrast must maintain at least a **4.5:1 ratio** to ensure readability under standard classroom ambient light.

### Elementary Subject Coding
* **Science (Agham):** Green accents (`#146C2E` / `#C4EED0`).
* **Mathematics (Matematika):** Blue accents (`#0B57D0` / `#D3E3FD`).
* **English:** Amber accents (`#705D00` / `#FFE16D`).
